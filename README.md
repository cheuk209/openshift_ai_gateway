You're absolutely right - I made assumptions about your current level. Let me give you a challenging project that will stretch you across all those foundational skills using OpenShift.

## Project: Multi-Tenant AI Platform with Advanced Security

**Scenario**: Build a production-ready AI platform for a financial services company that serves multiple business units, each with different security requirements and cost budgets.

### Architecture Requirements

**Multi-tenant isolation**: Each business unit gets their own namespace with strict network policies
**Multiple AI providers**: Route to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI based on data classification
**Compliance**: All traffic must be logged, encrypted, and auditable
**Cost control**: Per-tenant billing with hard limits and alerts
**High availability**: Zero downtime deployments with circuit breakers

### Phase 1: Service Mesh & Ingress (Weeks 1-2)

**Install and configure Istio on OpenShift**:
```bash
# You'll need to figure out OpenShift-specific Istio installation
# Configure ingress gateway for external traffic
# Set up east-west gateway for inter-cluster communication
```

**Challenges you'll face**:
- OpenShift's security context constraints vs Istio's requirements
- Route vs Ingress resource conflicts
- Getting Istio sidecars to work with OpenShift's strict security policies

**Stretch goal**: Configure multiple ingress points - one for internal traffic (corporate network), one for external (internet), with different security policies.

### Phase 2: Advanced Authentication (Week 3)

**Implement JWT validation chain**:
1. Corporate LDAP → OpenShift OAuth → JWT tokens
2. Service-to-service mTLS certificates
3. API key validation for external clients

**The tricky part**: Chain multiple auth methods - users authenticate via LDAP, services use mTLS, and external systems use API keys. All need to map to the same RBAC policies.

**Stretch challenge**: Implement token refresh and rotation without service interruption.

### Phase 3: Sophisticated Rate Limiting (Week 4)

**Multi-dimensional rate limiting**:
- Per-tenant request limits
- Per-user within tenant limits  
- Different limits for different AI model tiers (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)
- Token-based limiting (not just request count)

**Complex scenario**: Business Unit A gets 1000 GPT-4 requests/hour but unlimited GPT-3.5. Business Unit B gets 500 requests/hour total but can burst to 2000 for 10 minutes.

**Implementation hint**: You'll need custom Envoy filters or Istio EnvoyFilters with Lua scripts.

### Phase 4: Circuit Breakers & Failover (Week 5)

**Smart failover logic**:
- If OpenAI returns 429 (rate limited), automatically retry with Claude
- If both primary providers fail, route to local Ollama deployment
- Different failure thresholds for different request types

**The challenge**: Circuit breakers need to be per-destination AND per-tenant. A failure in one tenant shouldn't trigger circuit breaking for others.

### Phase 5: mTLS & Certificate Management (Week 6)

**Certificate rotation without downtime**:
- Automatic cert generation for new services
- Rotation of service certificates every 24 hours
- External certificate integration (Let's Encrypt for ingress, corporate CA for internal)

**OpenShift-specific challenge**: Integrate with OpenShift's built-in certificate management while maintaining Istio's mTLS requirements.

## Expected Learning Curve

**Week 1**: You'll struggle with OpenShift's security model vs Istio's requirements. Expect lots of "permission denied" errors.

**Week 2**: Ingress routing will be confusing - OpenShift Routes vs Kubernetes Ingress vs Istio Gateway. You'll need to understand which to use when.

**Week 3**: JWT validation chains will break in subtle ways. Token validation works in dev but fails in production due to timing issues.

**Week 4**: Rate limiting will be the hardest part. Envoy's rate limiting is powerful but complex. You'll need to read Envoy documentation deeply.

**Week 5**: Circuit breaker configuration will require understanding failure modes you've never considered.

**Week 6**: Certificate management will work perfectly in testing, then break mysteriously in production due to renewal timing.

## Success Metrics

By the end, you should be able to:
- Debug Envoy proxy configurations by reading access logs
- Troubleshoot mTLS certificate issues across service boundaries  
- Configure complex rate limiting policies from first principles
- Handle zero-downtime certificate rotation
- Explain the difference between authentication, authorization, and admission control in your sleep

## Resources to Get Started

**OpenShift + Istio specific**:
- Red Hat's Service Mesh documentation (OpenShift's Istio distribution)
- OpenShift networking deep-dive documentation

**When you get stuck**:
- Envoy proxy documentation (for understanding what Istio is actually doing)
- Istio troubleshooting guide
- OpenShift must-gather for debugging complex networking issues

Does this project seem appropriately challenging? Should I adjust the complexity up or down, or focus on specific areas you're most concerned about?
