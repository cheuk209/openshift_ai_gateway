# Low-Cost OpenShift Cluster Options for Learning

This document outlines the best options for setting up an OpenShift cluster for this learning project, with a focus on minimizing costs.

### 1. Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC) - Recommended

This is the ideal choice for a local development and learning environment.

*   **What it is:** A minimal, pre-configured OpenShift cluster that runs on your local machine (laptop or desktop). It provides a single-node cluster, which is sufficient for this project.
*   **Cost:** **Free**. It utilizes your local computer's resources.
*   **Pros:**
    *   No risk of incurring cloud provider bills.
    *   Provides a complete and genuine OpenShift environment.
    *   Works offline after the initial setup.
    *   Relatively straightforward to install and manage.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires a reasonably powerful host machine (recommended: 8-16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores to dedicate to the cluster).

### 2. OpenShift Developer Sandbox

A great alternative if your local machine is not powerful enough to run CRC.

*   **What it is:** A free, shared, time-limited OpenShift cluster hosted by Red Hat. You access it entirely through your web browser.
*   **Cost:** **Free**.
*   **Pros:**
    *   No local installation or resource consumption.
    *   Very quick and easy to get started.
    *   It's a real, multi-node OpenShift cluster.
*   **Cons:**
    *   The environment is temporary and will be deleted after a set period (e.g., 30 days, though renewal is often possible).
    *   You have limited administrative privileges.
    *   Resources are shared and can be limited.

### 3. Cloud Provider Free Tier (Use with Caution)

You can install the open-source version of OpenShift (OKD) on a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

*   **What it is:** You provision virtual machines within a cloud provider's free tier and manually install and configure an OKD cluster.
*   **Cost:** **Potentially free, but carries risk.** OpenShift's control plane is resource-intensive, and it is very easy to accidentally provision resources that fall outside the free tier, leading to unexpected charges.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides experience with a cloud-based deployment.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High risk of incurring costs.**
    *   Significantly more complex and time-consuming to set up compared to CRC or the Developer Sandbox.
    *   Requires diligent management of cloud resources to stay within free tier limits.

### Recommendation

For this project, the strong recommendation is to start with **Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC)**. It offers the best combination of a realistic OpenShift experience, full administrative control, and zero cost.

If your computer cannot run CRC, the **OpenShift Developer Sandbox** is the next best option.
