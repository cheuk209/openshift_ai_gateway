# Low-Cost OpenShift Cluster Options for Learning

This document outlines the best options for setting up an OpenShift cluster for this learning project, with a focus on minimizing costs.

### 1. Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC) - Recommended

This is the ideal choice for a local development and learning environment.

*   **What it is:** A minimal, pre-configured OpenShift cluster that runs on your local machine (laptop or desktop). It provides a single-node cluster, which is sufficient for this project.
*   **Cost:** **Free**. It utilizes your local computer's resources.
*   **Pros:**
    *   No risk of incurring cloud provider bills.
    *   Provides a complete and genuine OpenShift environment.
    *   Works offline after the initial setup.
    *   Relatively straightforward to install and manage.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires a reasonably powerful host machine (recommended: 8-16 GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores to dedicate to the cluster).

### 2. OpenShift Developer Sandbox

A great alternative if your local machine is not powerful enough to run CRC.

*   **What it is:** A free, shared, time-limited OpenShift cluster hosted by Red Hat. You access it entirely through your web browser.
*   **Cost:** **Free**.
*   **Pros:**
    *   No local installation or resource consumption.
    *   Very quick and easy to get started.
    *   It's a real, multi-node OpenShift cluster.
*   **Cons:**
    *   The environment is temporary and will be deleted after a set period (e.g., 30 days, though renewal is often possible).
    *   You have limited administrative privileges.
    *   Resources are shared and can be limited.

### 3. Cloud Provider Free Tier (Use with Caution)

You can install the open-source version of OpenShift (OKD) on a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

*   **What it is:** You provision virtual machines within a cloud provider's free tier and manually install and configure an OKD cluster.
*   **Cost:** **Potentially free, but carries risk.** OpenShift's control plane is resource-intensive, and it is very easy to accidentally provision resources that fall outside the free tier, leading to unexpected charges.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Provides experience with a cloud-based deployment.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **High risk of incurring costs.**
    *   Significantly more complex and time-consuming to set up compared to CRC or the Developer Sandbox.
    *   Requires diligent management of cloud resources to stay within free tier limits.

### Recommendation

For this project, the strong recommendation is to start with **Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC)**. It offers the best combination of a realistic OpenShift experience, full administrative control, and zero cost.

If your computer cannot run CRC, the **OpenShift Developer Sandbox** is the next best option.

## Decision and Best Practices

After consideration of the options, **Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC)** has been chosen for this project.

### Best Practices for Running and Maintaining CRC

Here are some best practices to ensure a smooth experience with CRC:

#### Resource Management

*   **System Requirements:** While CRC can run with 4 vCPUs and 9 GB of RAM, allocating more resources is recommended for a better experience, especially if you plan to run additional services. A minimum of 8 vCPUs, 16GB of RAM, and 70GB of storage is a good starting point.
*   **Configuration:** You can adjust the memory and CPU allocated to the CRC virtual machine using the `crc config set` command. For example, to set the memory to 16GB, you would run `crc config set memory 16384`. These changes require a restart of the CRC instance to take effect (`crc stop` and `crc start`).
*   **Hardware Virtualization:** Ensure that hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) is enabled in your system's BIOS.

#### Daily Use

*   **Starting and Stopping:** Use `crc start` to start the cluster and `crc stop` to shut it down.
*   **Network:** Be aware that some VPN clients can interfere with CRC's networking. It's often necessary to disconnect from a VPN when running CRC.
*   **Accessing the Cluster:** Use the `oc` command-line tool and the web console to interact with your OpenShift cluster. The `crc start` command will provide you with the necessary credentials and the web console URL.

#### Maintenance and Troubleshooting

*   **Updates:** Keep CRC and your host operating system up to date to benefit from the latest bug fixes and features.
*   **Clean Slate:** If you encounter persistent issues, you can use `crc delete` to completely remove the CRC virtual machine and start fresh.
*   **Monitoring:** The cluster monitoring operator is disabled by default to conserve resources. If you need to monitor your cluster's performance, you can enable it, but be sure to increase the memory allocated to CRC to at least 14GB.

### Interacting with the cluster

The most common ways of interacting with the cluster include:

Start the graphical web console:

$ crc console

    
Display the clusterâ€™s status:

$ crc status

Shut down the OpenShift cluster:

$ crc stop

Delete or kill the OpenShift cluster:

$ crc delete
